# Projects
This is project of offline music player as my first python and git repo. 

# Perspective
As per fresher there are many ideas to create project, but in daily life i would like to play song when i am code or doing the other stuff.

# Build of the project
I devided whole prlject in the problems and make the modules.

*1) Main.py*

Main.py file which conatain the whole code and this is the final executable programme.
Main.py contains many python file as sub-modules.

*2) Player.py*

This file is manipulate with with music. It contain many functions.
But there is a problem, If the song is ended then we have to write the function to play another music.

*3) Song_Loader.py*

Using this file, the programme will automatically detect the .mp3 file from the Music folder and put it in the Text Files/Music.txt

*4) Search.py*

This file is in in the **Player.py** to make search and play function.

*5) Play_all.py*

This file use for the function in the **Main.py** to play all the avialable sont.

*6) shuffle.py*

This file is playe the song in shuffle mode which is in **Player.py**.

*7) Make_Playlist.py*

This file is used to create the playlist of the music which is in **Main.py**.


# How to use the player
This is the *CLI* base programme, so you have to run **Main.py** file in the cmd.This is work on only windows.
Open the Music file and read the instruction.txt then put all the music files in it.
Run the Main.py and enjoy your music.
